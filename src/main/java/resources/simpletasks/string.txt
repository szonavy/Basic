This exercise is to test your understanding of Java Strings. A sample String declaration:
String myString = "Hello World!"

The elements of a String are called characters. The number of characters in a String is called the length, and it can be retrieved with the String.length() method.

Given two strings of lowercase English letters, A and B, perform the following operations:

1.Sum the lengths of A and B.
2.Determine if A is lexicographically larger than B (i.e.: does  come before  in the dictionary?).
3.Capitalize the first letter in A and B and print them on a single line, separated by a space.

Input:
The first line contains a string A. The second line contains another string B. The strings are comprised of only lowercase English letters.

Output:
There are three lines of output:
For the first line, sum the lengths of A and B.
For the second line, write Yes if A is lexicographically greater than B otherwise print No instead.
For the third line, capitalize the first letter in both A and B and print them on a single line, separated by a space.
