3. Create an Employee class
   name: Employee
   fields:
        - id            int
        - firstName     String
        - lastName      String
        - salary        int
   constructor:
           - one constructor, which can configure all the 4 fields:   Employee(id, firstName, lastName, salary)
   methods:
           - getName()                 - return value String, return with the Employee's full name
           - getAnnualSalary()         - return value int, return with annual salary
           - raiseSalary(int percent)  - there aren't return value, increase the salary with the given percent

4. Create an Account class
    name: Account
    fields:
          - id            int
          - name          String
          - balance       int
    constructors:
          - Account(id, name)
          - Account(id, name, balance)

    methods:
          - credit(int amount)       - there aren't return value, increase the value of the balance with the given amount
          - debit(int amount)        - there aren't return value, decrease the value of the balance with the given amount, but if the value of the new amount less than 0,
                                        we don't decrease it just on the console "amount exceeded"
          - transferTo(Account anotherAccount, int amount)     - there aren't return value, if the value of the balance greater,
                                                                than the amount, we can move the value of the amount from the balance to anotherAccount balance,
                                                                otherwise write on the console:  "amount exceeded"

5.In the main class/methods create an employee and an account object

    - let there be 4 employees : T, V, A, Z
    - salary: greater than 0 (optional), id all of them different int
    - let there be 4 accounts: everybody has one (the name reflects the owner)
    - id different and the balance greater than 0, optional int

6.
    - Write out the values of the employees (full name, annual salary)
    - Increase T's salary double, A's salary with 10 percent
    - Write the values of the employees (full name, annual salary) again

7.
    - write the values of the accounts to the console
    - Add 100 amount to T's account ( with methods) - write the value of the new balance
    - Transfer from T's account 50 to V's account -  Write T and V's values of account.
    - Spend 50 from V's account and write the new value on the console
    - Spend 10.0000 from V's account
