write a program that enters a number from the screen, sums it up and displays how many prime numbers there are from 0 to the received number

- you have to use while to solve the problem
- create methods
- (practically, you can list the prime numbers and write the result only at the end)

e.g:
input: 23

outputs:
There are 8 prime numbers up to 23: [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 23]
